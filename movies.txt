Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 | Watched 12/20/25

Good movie, better than what many reviews made it out to be. Shouldn't have based my views off of people like the Killcount guy.
Good cinematography, two okay MCs. Don't know how/why some people think this movie glorifies Bubba or that it's painting him as "hero".
The side characters are okay. The zoomer tiktok kids are annoying, but they're meant to be and they have little to no screetime anyway.

Bus scene was great and Lila as a character is good too.
